I am a frontend designer and developer at GitHub. I made my way here via open government development at Code for America, urban design at the City of Boston's Redevelopment Authority and architecture in Atlanta and Georgia Tech. It all makes perfect sense.

I've got a little open source library, sheetsee.js, for using Google Spreadsheets to power charts, maps and tables on websites real easy-like. During my Code for America fellowship I built: See Penny Work, sheetsee.js and MTA Transit Map. I also like to make things myself and there is a website for that, too: ECAB.

I hail from the heart of Georgia but for now I live in Oakland, California.

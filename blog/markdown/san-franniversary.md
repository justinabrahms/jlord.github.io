It&#8217;s my San Franniversary! A year ago today I flew to California for the first time to do this <a title="Code for America" href="http://www.codeforamerica.org" target="_blank">CfA</a> thing. Of course, I now live in the warmer, flatter, node.js-ier and according to me, all around nicer Oakland, but that doesn&#8217;t play as nicely with &#8216;anniversary&#8217;. Also, what a year!

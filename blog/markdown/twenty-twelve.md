Farewell, 2012! It&#8217;s been real. Went a lot of places during my Code for America fellowship this year, but not in middle America, which is just as well, I needed a place to drop a vertical calendar in this map.

<a title="Code for America" href="http://www.codeforamerica.org" target="_blank">Code for America</a> was the best decision I&#8217;ve made and this has been the best year I&#8217;ve had. That&#8217;s it and that&#8217;s all.Â #woowoo

Happy New Year!
